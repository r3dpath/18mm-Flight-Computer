# The 18mm flight computer competition

As previously mentioned the goal is to design a cheap, simple to use altimeter for the Christchurch Rocketeers. 
To add another dimension to this challenge we also want you to keep clear and concise documentation, because hate it or love it you all have a lot of documentation in your future carrers. It dosn't have to be, and infact is better if it isn't long. To help with this have a look at the A3 planning document and keep updating this as you progress with the project. Once your done write up a short wiki instruction manual/pich style documenting the features, considerations and perks of your design. Good luck!

## How to get your own repository
You have about 2 choices here, either:  
a) Fork this repository into your own account and start working from there, the button should be up near the top right of this window. This will make it easy for us to keep tabs and give feedback.  
b) Download the important bits from this repo and then make your own, this way it can be private if you like but just make sure to add me to it before the deadline and probably would be best to let me know on discord.  
  
To keep upto date check in on the comp forum, which is part of the avionics and tracking section on discord.
